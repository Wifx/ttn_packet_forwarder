/* Note that the ghost receive buffer must be large enough to store the
 * burst of data coming in just after the wait period in the main cycle
 * has commenced. In reality this wait state is one of the limiting factors
 * of the capacity. I am unaware of the number of packates the concentrator
 * can store, but my suspicion is 8. In this code the wait state is 10ms,
 * so this limits the maximum throughput in reality on: 8/0.01 = 800 packets/sec.
 * Although in burst mode it may be higher, since the wait time is not the
 * limiting factor at that moment.
